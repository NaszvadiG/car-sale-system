# Car-sale-system

Note: This was merely a quick assessment task for my course :).

For a demo, visit http://jeffnielsen.net/projects/5x5/index.php

The following is a car sale system built using Codeigniter. It allows visitors to browse and place orders or enquires for cars. The site also features a little admin panel for adding cars and going through orders and enquiries.

Tools used:
- Codeigniter 2
- Bootstrap
- jQuery validation
- Cycles 2
